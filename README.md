# AI Lab

**Important**: see https://youtu.be/GqrmkpKBlyI for an explanatory setup of this initial AI lab.

An AI lab allows you to experiment with AI models locally without requiring the most expensive setup.
It is meant to be a great way for you to get into AI models and become an enthusiast.

This repository requires an installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (with Docker Compose).

### Asking a prompt in the CLI

In order to ask a prompt, pass in the prompt as the example that follows:

```bash
    python client.py -t "My Example" -c "This is an example of a data mart in SQL." "It has two tables: fact and dimension."
```
